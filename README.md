Leave Management System – Web Dashboard
A simple and clean Leave Management System (LMS) web application designed to streamline how employees request leave and how HR/admins manage leave records.
This project was created as part of a group assignment, with a focus on professional UI design, user navigation, and functional interaction.

📌 Purpose of the System
The purpose of this Leave Management System is to:
Provide a centralised platform for employees to request different types of leave.
Allow HR or administrators to view, monitor, and manage all leave applications.
Display important leave statistics such as pending requests, approved requests, and overall leave balances.
Give users access to their profile, activity, and performance in an easy-to-navigate design.
Create a professional interface suitable for real-world HR workflows and team project presentations.
This website focuses on user experience, clean layout, and intuitive navigation rather than backend functionality.

🎯 Problem Statement
Managing leave manually through emails, WhatsApp messages, or spreadsheets often leads to:
Lost or untracked leave requests
Slow approval processes
No clear record of past leave
Limited visibility for HR when managing multiple employees
Confusion about available leave days
The goal of this solution is to provide a simple, digital, and organised system that eliminates these issues.

✅ Solution Overview
The Leave Management System provides:

1. Dashboard View
A high-level summary of:
Total leave days
Approved leave
Pending leave
Rejected leave
The dashboard gives HR or the employee a quick overview of leave records.
2. Leave Requests Page
Displays all leave requests in a clean table format, including:
Employee name
Leave type
Start date
End date
Status (Approved, Pending, Rejected)
This allows management to quickly review applications.
3. Profile Section
Includes three interactive subtabs:
About → Personal details
Activity → Recent actions related to leave
Performance → Employee rating and history
This section improves user engagement and adds depth to the system.
4. Notifications
A clean notification panel showing:
Approved leave alerts
Pending request reminders
System updates
5. Responsive Sidebar Navigation
The sidebar includes tabs such as:
Pending Leave
Leave Requests
Balances
Notifications
Profile
The navigation is fully interactive using JavaScript.
